INTEGRATION PROBLEMS.

- commute: since the current evaluation of commuting function relies on the multiverse provided functions

- alter: since the evaluation of function rely on the multiverse provided functions

- transaction: currently the multiverse transaction is pushed.. not the scala one

TODO:

- implicit transactions

- fat atomic block for propagation support

DONE

- methods depending on predicates: also rely on multiverse provided predicates

- mapping of transactions to Scala STM exceptions: Not needed
